8. [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) - PyTorch is an open source machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing.
9.7. Theano is a computational framework machine learning library in Python for computing multidimensional arrays.(better use tenserflow)


Java
======

1. [Dozer](https://github.com/DozerMapper/dozer) - Mapper that copies data from one object to another using annotations and API or XML configuration.
2. [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Declarative build and dependency management that favors convention over configuration. It might be preferable to Apache Ant, which uses a rather procedural approach and can be difficult to maintain.
3. [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) - Incremental builds programmed via Groovy instead of declaring XML. Works well with Maven's dependency management.
4. [Singularity](http://getsingularity.com/) - Mesos framework that makes deployment and operations easy. It supports web services, background workers, scheduled jobs, and one-off tasks.
5. [picocli](http://picocli.info/) - ANSI colors and styles in usage help. Can be included as source to avoid dependency. Annotation-based, POSIX/GNU/any syntax, subcommands, strong typing for both options and positional args.
